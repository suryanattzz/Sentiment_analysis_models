# Sentiment Analysis Models

This repository contains three sentiment analysis models for different types of text data: Tweets, Movie Reviews, and Generic Text (using Machine Learning).

### LSTM Model for Movie Reviews
- **File:** `movie_review_sentiment_analysis.py`
- **Description:** This script trains an LSTM model for sentiment analysis on movie reviews.

### LSTM Model for Tweets
- **File:** `tweets_sentiment_analysis.py`
- **Description:** This script trains an LSTM model for sentiment analysis on tweets.

### Machine Learning Model
- **File:** `ML_sentiment_analysis_models.py`
- **Description:** This script trains a machine learning models (Logistic Regression,Naive Bayes ,RandomForest ,DecisionTree ,etc Models) for sentiment analysis on a generic dataset.
